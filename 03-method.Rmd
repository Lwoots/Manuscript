##Field methods

Field work was conducted in the Knersvlakte Nature Reserve, situated near Vanrhynsdorp on the West coast of South Africa (18.548036,-31.264916). Three sites were selected within  . Each grid consisted of 11 x 11 plots, each 1 m^2^ in size (Fig. \@ref(fig:grid)). The plots were located 5m apart from centre to centre. We identified and recorded the abundance of all species present in each plot, as well as taking a soil sample to a depth of 10 cm from the centre of each plot. The soil samples were sieved with a 5 mm sieve to remove large stones. The stones were then discarded.

##Soil processing


Soil samples from 151 plots were used for soil property analysis. These were selected from every second plot from every second row (Fig. \@ref(fig:grid)). An additional 49 samples were randomly selected from sites 1 and 2, while 53 were randomly selected from site 3.

The soil fractions between 1 - 2 mm and 2 - 5mm were weighed and discarded. The remaining soil was then quartered to ensure that a representive fraction of soil was used in further analyses. The samples were sent to the Elsenburg Soil, Plant and Water Laboratory, Stellenbosch, for analysis of Ca, Mg, Na, K, inorganic P, Olsen P and acidity. Soil particle sizes were measured with a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK), after being suspended in water to allow organic matter to float to the surface and be removed by hand.

##Analysis

###JSDM

A joint model is a parametric model of abundance for multiple species. It models the response to environmental predictors while simultaneously accounting for correlations between taxa [@Warton2015]. The model incorporates latent variables, which act as missing predictors. The relationship between the response variable and the latent variable is known as the factor loadings. Factor loadings estimate the strength of the correlation between the abundance for different taxa and the latent variable. If two taxa correlate with the LV, then they also correlate with each other. Ie LVs induce correlations between taxa. Therefore LVM is computationally efficient compared to GLMMs, GLMMs estimate the correlation between every single taxa which results in a huge matrix of parameters to compute. The model complexity can be increased by adding more LVs, but generally less than 5 is enough to model most interactions. 

Correlation between taxa could be due to biotic interactions, although it could also be a joint response to unmeasured predictors or due to a misspecification of the model.

Comparision of ordinations of LV and factor loadings can show how NB environmental predictors are.
