# Hypotheses {#hyp}

What causes succulent plant species distribution in the Knersvlakte? 


##Hypothesis 1 {#hyp1}

**Abiotic variables determine species distribution.**

Predictions:

* Distribution can be predicted based on envirnomental variables alone.
* Ability to predict abundance and occurrence differs.
    * Occurrence is due to environmental filtering. Only species with the correct traits can occur in a given set of abiotic variables [@DelaRiva2016]
    * Abundance is due to biotic interactions, which influence competition and therefore coexistence [@DelaRiva2016]

##Hypothesis 2 {#hyp2}

**Biotic variables determine species distribution**

Predictions:

* Distribution can be predicted based on other species occurrence.
* Should be correlations between the occurrence of species.
* Large species shouldn't co-occur due to a larger niche overlap

##Hypothesis 3 {#hyp3}

**The determinants of distribution depend on plant size

Predictions:

* Smaller species are easier to predict based on abiotic variables
* Large species shouldn't co-occur due to a larger niche overlap
